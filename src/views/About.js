            <p>
                When the country went into lockdown on Friday, March 13, 2020, to prevent the spread of COVID 19, a group of concerned recovering addicts fearing that LGBTQIA+ folk
                would not have a safe space to continue their recovery created ZIOR.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first official meeting was, March 17, 2020, at 7:00pm EST, and every day since. The group decided that we should meet nightly to assure that our members had a
                space to process the pandemic as it was unfolding. We named the group, Zoom in on Recovery, because we were acutely aware that we needed to concentrate on bringing
                NAâ€™s spiritual principles into this new environment. We chose the Just for Today daily meditation to provide structure and consistency for our new group.
            </p>
            <p>
                We continue meeting and enjoy an attendance of roughly 40 members nightly. Zoom in on Recovery has established a group policy, we contribute quarterly to the
                Manhattan Area Service Committee, Greater New York Regional Service Committee, and the World Service Committee. We are proud to have started a Basic Text Gift
                Program, which provides a physical or digital copy to members needing this most essential tool. This program was an extension of and tangible expression of
                hospitality. We are intentional about welcoming newcomers, maintaining a safe space that is born of our commitment to practicality.

                While we are a special interest group, our meetings are open to everyone! Even those who are just contemplating staying clean. The meeting is a one-hour book study,
                holds space for a burning desire, and touts a robust parking lot before and after the meeting! On occasion, the parking lot is more formal with a group member
                facilitating the discussion.
